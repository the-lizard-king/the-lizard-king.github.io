                As a Portlander born and raised I love to bike around. I was taught 
                to bike from a young age and there were lots of bike rides happening 
                that my family and I went on. As I grew up I carried that spirit with
                me and now I love to bike with my friends and go see new things.
                Pictured to the left is a ride I took through the Roman country side
                with my father on our trip to Italy.

                Here is another photo of a bike ride my friends and I did around Portland 
                and down the spring water corridor. One of the things I love so much about 
                Portland is how nice it is to bike around. There are many amazing bike trails 
                and even when biking through neighborhoods theres always lots of greenery year 
                round.
